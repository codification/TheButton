Bugs:

Improvements:
     - Refactor!
        - Time string formatting and tracks to be less cumbersome
        - Eliminate the widespread dependencies on yoda time (should only be used by the core tracking func.)
        

Features:
     - Add a (optional) subject/title to each track
     - Save/Persist tracks
     - Re-read saved tracks
     - Configure filtering of tracks (today, subject)
     - Configure track length (รก la pomodoro)
     - Add notification/blink when preconfigured track length is reached
